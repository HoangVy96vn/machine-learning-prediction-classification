Use machine learning to predict with classification case

We have dataset of customer to use or not use service anymore.
Let's use machine learning to create model predict whether customer will use no stop using service

Build my prediction model in file prediction only (Jupyter)
I used Gridsearch CV for tunning, however, the result wasn't good. If you have any feedback, please let me know, I'm really appreciated
